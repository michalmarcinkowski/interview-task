/**
 *
 * In our domain model, `InvoiceProductLine` is explicitly modeled as an **Entity**,
 * not a Value Object. This is a critical design decision for the following reasons:
 *
 * Even though not states explicitly in the requirements, I made the following assumptions:
 * 
 * 1.  Unique Identity is Required: An invoice can contain multiple lines that are
 * otherwise identical (e.g., two separate entries for the same product).
 * To manage these linesâ€”for instance, to delete or update a *specific* oneâ€”each
 * line must have a stable identity that is independent of its attributes.
 * Equality is therefore based on its unique ID, not the values of its properties.
 *
 * 2.  Has a Distinct Life Cycle: A product line has its own life cycle within the
 * `Invoice` aggregate. It is created, can be modified (e.g., the quantity can be
 * updated while the invoice is a draft), and can be deleted. This concept of
 * persistence and change over time is characteristic of an Entity.
 *
 * 3.  Mutability: Value Objects are immutable by definition. Since the attributes of
 * an invoice line may need to be updated during the drafting phase of an invoice,
 * it requires mutability, which aligns with the nature of an Entity.
 *
 * By modeling this as an Entity, we ensure the integrity of the `Invoice` aggregate
 * and accurately reflect the business requirement of managing distinct, individual
 * line items.
